Josh by Shel Silverstein

Josh loves me,
Josh cares,
Josh picks me peaches and pears.
Josh offers me candy and Cokes,
Josh listens and laughs at me jokes.
Josh helps when I get in a fight,
Josh does all my homework at night.
Josh misses me,
Josh cries,
Josh thinks I'm a wonderful guy.
So if you ask me who's my best friend, in a whiz,
I'll stand up and tell you that Josh is.
But yesterday night I got quite a scare,
I woke up and Josh just wasn't there.
I called out and reached out for Josh's hand,
In the darkness where Josh usually stands.
Then I poked through the house, in each cranny and nook,
But I found somebody each place that I looked.
I searched till I'm tired, and now with the dawn,
There's no doubt about it-
Josh's gone!
